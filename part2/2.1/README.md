2.1: Course information step6

Let's finish the code for rendering course contents from exercises 1.1 - 1.5. You can start with the code from the model answers. The model answers for part 1 can be found by going to the submission system, click on my submissions at the top, and in the row corresponding to part 1 under the solutions column click on show. To see the solution to the course info exercise, click on index.js under kurssitiedot ("kurssitiedot" means "course info").

Note that if you copy a project from one place to another, you might have to delete the node_modules directory and install the dependencies again with the command npm install before you can start the application. Generally, it's not recommended that you copy a project's whole contents and/or add the node_modules directory to the version control system.
